# cpp-log-profiler

A lightweight C++ utility for profiling and logging the execution time of functions and code blocks.  
Built to practice RAII, `<chrono>`, and clean library-style design.

## ✨ Features

- Macro-based timing for functions and custom code blocks
- Aggregated statistics (min / max / average)
- Simple API that can be dropped into other C++ projects
- Minimal dependencies (standard library only)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- C++ (C++17 or later)
- `<chrono>`, `<iostream>`, `<fstream>`

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shaheer12345678/cpp-log-profiler.git
cd cpp-log-profiler
# build instructions here, e.g.:
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 main.cpp -o profiler-demo
./profiler-demo
